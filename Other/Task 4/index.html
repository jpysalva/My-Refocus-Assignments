    <h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
    <p>I love being infront of a computer and I love how it works especially the internet.
        I want to be a web developer because its my weakness back in college when I was still studying.
        I graduated in Multimedia Arts. I was somehow good in every subject besides web development 
        which is back then I find it difficult to understand. But now, I want to learn and understand it and turn my weakness into my strength.
